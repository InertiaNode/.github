# InertiaNode

Welcome to the **InertiaNode** GitHub organization â€” the home for using [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

[InertiaNode](https://github.com/InertiaNode/adapter) allows developers to build modern, single-page applications using classic server-side routing and controllers in Node.js. It brings together the simplicity of server-driven apps with the rich interactivity of modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue, React, and Svelte. With InertiaNode, you write your backend logic using familiar MVC or minimal API patterns, and your frontend using your preferred JavaScript framework.

We support the following frameworks:
- Hono
- Express
- Koa

## What is InertiaNode?

InertiaNode provides a lightweight middleware and tooling layer that allows Node.js to serve Inertia.js-powered frontends without the complexity of building and maintaining a separate API. With InertiaNode, you write your backend logic using familiar MVC or minimal API patterns, and your frontend using your preferred JavaScript framework.

Key features:

- Tight integration with Express, Hono, and Koa
- Zero client-side routing setup
- Server-side redirects and validation flow
- Shared props/types between server and client
- SSR-friendly
